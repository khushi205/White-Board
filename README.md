# White-Board
Creating a simple digital whiteboard with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several key steps, including setting up the user interface, defining the canvas for drawing, and implementing the drawing logic.
Key Features 
  #Canvas Drawing:  
      The mousemove, mousedown, and mouseup events are used to track the mouse's movement and allow drawing on the canvas.
      Brush Size & Color: Inputs are provided to change the brush's color and size dynamically.
      Clear Board: The board can be cleared by clicking the "Clear" button, which uses the clearRect function to wipe the canvas clean.
      Responsive Design: The canvas adjusts its size based on the window dimensions.
